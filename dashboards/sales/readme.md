# üõí Power BI Dashboard Development for Retail Sales Analysis

Welcome to the directory for a personal project I developed to showcase my skills with Power BI, focusing on creating an interactive dashboard for retail sales analysis. This project was a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge of DAX, SQL, ETL, and data processing for creating reports and interactive visualizations.

## üìú Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build an interactive sales dashboard that provides clear insights into product and temporal performance. Since Power BI is a resource-intensive tool, it was challenging to use it efficiently on a personal computer. However, this allowed me to explore various techniques to optimize workflow and maximize performance despite hardware limitations.

## üöÄ Key Achievements

- Created a sales dashboard with interactive metrics for tracking revenue, sales volume, and product performance.
- Applied DAX calculations to build advanced metrics, including seasonal variation analysis and product segmentation.
- Utilized SQL and ETL techniques for data extraction and transformation, ensuring that the data was ready for analysis.
- Developed a thorough data cleaning process to normalize and structure tables for efficient use.

## üéØ Project Objectives

**Main Objectives**:

- Showcase my expertise with Power BI, DAX, and SQL by developing dynamic dashboards.
- Build an intuitive sales analysis dashboard that delivers valuable insights into store performance.
- Explore ETL tools and data processing techniques to prepare reliable and consistent data for visualization.

## üîß Methodology & Techniques

In developing this project, I applied a range of techniques and tools to ensure the dashboard was comprehensive and user-friendly:

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For custom calculations and complex analytics within Power BI.
- **SQL**: Used to prepare and transform the raw data, creating optimized queries for data manipulation.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Used to transform raw data into meaningful, easy-to-interpret information.
- **Data Processing**: Included removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing information.


## üìà Project Impact

This project was an excellent way to consolidate my Power BI skills, especially regarding the creation of sales dashboards. It also allowed me to work with the performance limitations of a personal computer, prompting me to explore best practices for query optimization and data modeling. The resulting dashboard offers valuable insights into store performance and could serve as a model for other business analytics.

Data and reference tables are available in the **Data Reference** folder.
